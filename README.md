# Introduction



This is the repository for 

Peter Phillips and Zhentao Shi (2019): "[Boosting the Hodrick-Prescott Filter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00175)"

in MATLAB and R.



* Update on 8/21/2020: [Matlab code](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Boosted_HP_filter/tree/master/matlab) is added into the MATLAB folder. It produces exactly the same results as the [R code](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Boosted_HP_filter/tree/master/R).

* Update on 8/18/2020: The [R code](https://github.com/zhentaoshi/Boosted_HP_filter/tree/master/R) is superseded by a new R package [BoostedHP](https://github.com/chenyang45/BoostedHP). 
  See the [vignette](https://github.com/chenyang45/BoostedHP/blob/master/vignettes/vignette.pdf) for its usage. 

We offer two scripts under each folder:

* `BoostedHP` contains the function to implement the automated boosted HP filter.
The inputs and outputs are detailed in the beginning of the function.
* `testing_example` is a script to demonstrate the usage of the filtering procedure.
