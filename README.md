## Introduction

This is an accompanying repository for the paper:

Peter Phillips and Zhentao Shi (2018): "Boosting the Hodrick-Prescott Filter" (to provide the arxiv link)

We offer two R script files.

* `BoostedHP.R` contains the R function to implement the automated boosted HP filter.
The inputs and outputs are detailed in the beginning of the function.
* `testing_example.R` is a script to demonstrate the usage of the filtering procedure.

We welcome comments about the paper and the code.

Yang Chen is developing the code here into an R package [BoostedHP](https://github.com/chenyang45/BoostedHP).
Though it is at a very preliminary stage, it can be installed and implemented in R.
