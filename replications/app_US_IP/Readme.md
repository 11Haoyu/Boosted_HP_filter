The recession data are obtained by running `data_recession.R`. The data are stored as `data_recession.Rdata` for replication.

`IPB50001SQ.csv` contains the original time series of US Industrial Production Index. After the filtering, it produces two dataset `residuals.Rdata` and `residuals_y.Rdata`. `Figure_8_9.R` and `Figure_B4_B5.R` use these two datasets to generate the figures.
